                <p>Hi. My name is Kelly Walls and I'm a 57 year old, Atlanta native. I graduated many years ago from Georgia State University
                    with a degree in Mathematics. During college I began working as a RPG programmer and I was able to parlay that
                    into a fairly successful career where I've worked for the same company for the past 29 years and I've been the
                    Chief Information Officer for the past 25 years. Do not ask why I've decided to enroll in a bootcamp at my age.
                    All I can say is that I needed a challenge!</p>
        
                <p>I have two grown children. My son Anderon is 27 years old and he graduated from the Naval Academy and is currently
                    a Lieutenant in the Navy. My daughter Deanna is 25 years old and she's determined to stay on my payroll forever.</p>
        
                <p>In my spare time I enjoy golf, working out and traveling with my wife.</p>
